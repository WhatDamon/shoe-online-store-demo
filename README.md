# Evoloop — 3D-Printed Casual Shoes (Demo)

A consumer-facing storefront demo for a fictional brand of **3D-printed casual / lifestyle shoes**
(digitally crafted, printed to order in your size). Built with **Next.js (App Router), Tailwind
and shadcn/ui on the Node runtime (Bun is the package manager only)** — with a server-side
shopping assistant that stays understated: consumer wording only, never "AI"-branded.

This is a **product prototype / frontend demo**: there is no real checkout on this site. PDPs
run a **custom demo flow** — demo price (placeholder **$59–79** band), size/color pickers and a
**Buy now** CTA that opens a **payment-QR checkout dialog** (a placeholder demo QR; no real
payment is initiated). A **Shopify Buy Button** channel (`SHOPIFY_BUY_*` env + handle map) is
retained in the codebase but deliberately **dormant** — the demo never configures it (a switchable
catalog adapter also remains for a future direct Storefront read). The catalog is a local seed of
**29 real supplier styles**
(imported from the supplier's workbook) with **real product photos** (WebP in `public/products/`);
image-less entries fall back to programmatic SVG visuals. `/shop` also carries the
"spend $50, get a free gift" offer with a gallery of leftover-offcut trinkets.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16.3.4** (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19 + TypeScript 5
- **Bun ≥ 1.3** as the package manager only (the `next` CLI and every gate script run on Node)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + **shadcn/ui** (Base UI preset)
- **Drizzle ORM**, dual-driver: **SQLite** (`better-sqlite3`, default, zero-setup) or
  **Postgres** (`postgres.js`, Cloud SQL-ready) — chosen by `DB_DRIVER` in the environment
- **Vitest** (unit + React Testing Library), **ESLint**, `tsc --noEmit`
- AI: OpenAI-compatible streaming client with a deterministic **Mock mode** when no key is set

## Prerequisites

- **Bun ≥ 1.3** (project ships `packageManager: bun@1.3.14`). Verify with `bun --version`.
- No API keys are required to run the demo — the AI assistant works in Mock mode.

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local      # defaults are fine — empty AI_API_KEY = Mock mode
bun run dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

> **Node runtime for Next.** The `next` CLI runs on Node; the SQLite driver is
> `better-sqlite3` (Node native, works on Bun too) — no Bun runtime needed for dev/build/start.
> Bun is the package manager only. `DB_DRIVER=postgres` (with a `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…`)
> switches to `postgres.js` — both drivers run on Node, Vercel-ready.

First run auto-creates the schema (**three** tables: `products` + `product_embeddings`,
`ai_usage`) via idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on **either** driver — SQLite file at
`./data/local.db`, or the Postgres database behind `DATABASE_URL`. No migration step.

**Catalog lives in the `products` table.** The catalog adapter defaults to reading the table;
when it is empty the first request auto-seeds it from the import layer (supplier JSON +
curation). `CATALOG_SOURCE=seed` switches back to the pure in-memory import layer (used by unit
tests); `SHOPIFY_*` still takes priority over both.

### What you can do without any setup

- Landing page, `/shop` (URL-driven filters), product detail pages (SSG, 29 products)
- Wishlist (localStorage), size picker with market conversion (US system by default)
- Floating assistant (right-bottom "Need a hand?" FAB on non-landing pages):
  chips `Find my size` / `Style it with` / `Help me pick` / `Everyday sneakers`,
  streamed answers, product result cards, deterministic size recommendation — all in Mock mode.
- PDP → "Find my size" opens the assistant pre-seeded with the current shoe.

## Scripts

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bun run dev` | Next dev server (Turbopack) on the **Node** runtime. |
| `bun run build` | Production build (Node runtime). |
| `bun run start` | Serve the production build (Node runtime). |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `bun run lint` | ESLint over the repo |
| `bun run test` | Vitest (54 files, 279 tests) on Node via the `better-sqlite3` driver. |
| `bun run verify` | One-shot acceptance gate: `format:check` + `typecheck` + `lint` + `test`. |
| `bun run test:watch` | Vitest watch mode |

The acceptance gate is **format:check + typecheck + lint + test + build**, all green on `main` (HEAD).

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the annotated template. Summary:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SITE_MARKET` | `US` | Market (`US\|EU\|UK\|JP\|CN`); drives the size-display system + mm-anchored conversions |
| `AI_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | **Empty → Mock mode** (zero cost, demoable). Set to enable the real OpenAI-compatible provider. |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | *(empty)* | OpenAI-compatible endpoint base URL (empty = official OpenAI) |
| `AI_MODEL` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Chat model for the real provider (2026-09: GPT-5.6 budget tier; quality-upgrade: `gpt-5.6-terra`) |
| `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | Embedding model for semantic search (cached locally) |
| `AI_MAX_TURNS` | `20` | Per-session turn cap (soft message when exceeded) |
| `AI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | `500` | Max output tokens per provider response |
| `AI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `20000` | Provider request timeout |
| `AI_MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS` | `800` | Max characters per incoming user message |
| `AI_DAILY_TOKEN_CAP` | `1000000` | Daily token budget (SUM over `ai_usage` per UTC day) |
| `AI_DISABLE_REAL` | `0` | `1` forces Mock mode even with a key (abuse kill switch) |
| `DB_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` (default) or `postgres` — selects the app DB driver |
| `CATALOG_SOURCE` | `db` | Runtime catalog source: `db` = `products` table (default, auto-seeded when empty); `seed` = in-memory import layer (tests); `SHOPIFY_*` still wins |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `./data/local.db` | sqlite: local file; postgres: `postgres://…` connection string |
| `SHOPIFY_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Reserved. Catalog adapter switches seed → Shopify only when **both** are set (not yet active). |
| `SHOPIFY_BUY_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_BUY_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | **PDP Shopify Buy Button channel** (2026-09): when **both** are set, every PDP mapped in `src/server/catalog/shopify-buy.ts` (29/29 store products, handle-keyed) renders a real Buy Button that takes over variant selection + checkout; unset keeps the demo pickers/price. Independent of the two vars above on purpose (setting those would trip the catalog stub). |

### Enabling real AI

1. Put a real key in `AI_API_KEY` (optionally `AI_BASE_URL` for a gateway / custom endpoint).
2. Set `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` + `AI_BASE_URL` to activate semantic retrieval; without them the
   assistant transparently uses keyword search over the catalog.
3. Restart. Guardrails (rate limit, turn cap, daily budget) apply to real and Mock alike.
   `AI_DISABLE_REAL=1` is the one-switch rollback to Mock.

### Switching market / sizes

`SITE_MARKET` is a **deployment-level, single-market** setting (no runtime market switching):
sizes are stored once in a canonical EU system and converted to the market's system
(US/EU/UK/JP/CN, foot-length-mm anchored) for display, filtering and "Find my size". Currency and
copy stay English/USD.

## Architecture notes

- **Catalog**: runtime source is the `products` DB table — auto-seeded from the import layer
  (29 supplier styles across 4 collections, curation in `seed.ts` over `data/supplier.json`)
  when empty; `/shop`, PDP and search all read the table, so edits (title, price, collection…)
  apply on the next dynamic request. `CATALOG_SOURCE=seed` keeps the pure in-memory layer for
  tests. Product cards and PDP galleries use real photos (`Product.images`, WebP under
  `public/products/<handle>/`) and fall back to SVG visuals only when image-less. A separate
  `gifts.ts` module feeds the `/shop` free-gift gallery (gifts are display-only, never in the
  sellable catalog).
- **Store buy channel** (2026-09): the linked Shopify store holds the same 29 products under
  matching handles. `src/server/catalog/shopify-buy.ts` is a **low-coupling static map** (local
  `handle` → store numeric id, no Product/DB/schema changes) read by the PDP page; when
  `SHOPIFY_BUY_DOMAIN` + `SHOPIFY_BUY_TOKEN` are set, the store-mapped PDP hides the demo
  price/pickers and mounts one parameterized `ShopifyBuyButton` (SDK `createComponent` loading
  the admin-generated options verbatim), letting the store own variants, price and checkout.
  Unset → all PDPs run the custom demo flow (**Buy now** → demo payment-QR dialog, placeholder
  `public/payments/checkout-demo-qr.png`; swap in a live QR image for a real payment demo).
- **AI**: RAG-lite, zero tool-calling — every real/gateway model only needs chat completions.
  Retrieved product cards are injected into the system prompt; the model must answer from that
  injected content only. Modes: `shopping`, `size-fit` (deterministic), `outfit`, `find-shoes`,
  and `support` (store-policy Q&A from the shared `src/lib/store-policy` facts).
- **Guardrails** (all anonymous, no PII): in-memory token bucket rate limit (IP + session),
  per-session turn cap + history trim + idle TTL, output-token cap + timeout, and a **persisted**
  daily token budget on `ai_usage`. Soft copy everywhere ("taking a short break"), never
  "rate limited". Runs entirely in-process (single-instance assumption — adequate for this demo
  deployment; revisit before multi-instance hosting).
- **Search**: embedding vectors cached in `product_embeddings` (contentHash-validated), keyed by
  `Product.id` (unchanged by the DB move), cosine in
  app code (fine below ~2k products — beyond that, move to a native vector backend).

## Known limitations

- **This site has no cart or checkout.** The detail CTA is a demo **Buy now** that opens a
  payment-QR dialog (`public/payments/checkout-demo-qr.png`, a placeholder that never charges) to
  demonstrate the order flow; a dormant `getBuyUrl` adapter contract returns `null` and the
  dormant Shopify Buy Button only activates if `SHOPIFY_BUY_*` env is ever configured.
- Unknown product handles return the not-found UI with **HTTP 200 + `noindex`** under the current
  `dynamicParams` SSG setting (a deliberate, documented tradeoff; revisit if SEO on 404s matters).
- Compliance: no cookies, no tracking, no personal data sent to AI providers. Anonymous `ai_usage`
  token counts are stored locally for budget enforcement only.

## Disclaimer

Demo / prototype. Brand: **Evoloop** (decided). Supplier product codes, photos, colors and size
segments are real (from the brand supply-chain workbook); English marketing names, prices and copy
are demo placeholders, as is the size conversion table (foot-length-mm anchored, canonical EU
35–48). The free-gift offer is a demo promotion. No real purchase flow is connected.
